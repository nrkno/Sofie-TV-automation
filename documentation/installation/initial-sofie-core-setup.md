# Initial Sofie Core Setup

#### Prerequisites

* [Installed and running Sofie Core](installing-sofie-server-core.md)

Once _Sofie-Core_ has been installed and is running you can begin setting it up. The first step is to navigate to the _Settings page_. Please review the [Sofie Access Level ](../getting-started/sofie-navigation.md)page for assistance getting there.

To upgrade to a newer version or installation of new blueprints, Sofie needs to run its "Upgrade database" procedure to migrate data and pre-fill various settings. You can do this by clicking the _Upgrade Database_ button in the menu. 

![Update Database Section of the Settings Page](../../.gitbook/assets/settings-page-full-update-db.jpg)

Fill in the form as prompted and continue by clicking _Run Migrations Procedure_. Sometimes you will need to go through multiple steps before the upgrade is finished.

Next, you will need to [add some Blueprints](installing-blueprints.md) and [add Gateways](installing-a-gateway/) to allow _Sofie_ to interpret rundown data and then play out things.
