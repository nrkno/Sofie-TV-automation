# Installation & Setup

The _Sofie_ system consists of several applications that work together to provide complete broadcast automation system. Each of these components' installation will be covered in this guide. Additional information about the products or services mentioned alongside the Sofie Installation can be found on the [Further Reading page](../../resources.md).

There are four minimum required components to get a Sofie system up and running. First you need the [_Sofie Core_](installing-sofie-server-core.md), which is the brains of the operation. Then a set of [_Blueprints_](installing-blueprints.md) __to handle and interpret incoming and outgoing data. Next, an [_Ingest Gateway_](installing-a-gateway/rundown-or-newsroom-system-connection/) __to fetch the data for the Blueprints. Then finally, a [_Playout Gateway_](installing-a-gateway/playout-gateway.md) to send the data to your playout device of choice.
