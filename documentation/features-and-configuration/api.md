# API

## REST API

There is a preliminary REST API available that can be used to fetch data and trigger actions.

The documentation is minimal at the moment, but the API-endpoints are listed by Sofie Core using the endpoint: `/api/0`

## DDP - Core-integration

If you're planning to build NodeJS applications that talk to Sofie Core, we recommend using the [core-integration](https://github.com/nrkno/tv-automation-server-core-integration) library, which exposes a number of callable methods and allows for subscribing to data the same way the [Gateways ](../dictionary.md#gateways)does it.
